# Basic Authentication Project

In this project, we will implement Basic Authentication for a simple API. While it is not recommended to implement your own Basic authentication system in the industry, this project is designed for educational purposes to help you understand the authentication process and the principles behind it.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain the concept of authentication.
- Understand what Base64 encoding is and how to encode a string in Base64.
- Define Basic authentication and its components.
- Learn how to send the Authorization header in HTTP requests.

## Requirements

**Python Scripts:**

- All code files should be written in Python 3 and will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.7).
- Ensure that all Python files end with a new line.
- The first line of all your Python files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`.

**Coding Style:**

- Your code should adhere to the pycodestyle style (version 2.5).

**Executable Files:**

- All Python files must be executable.

**File Length:**

- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

**Documentation:**

- Provide documentation for all modules, classes, and functions.
- Modules: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)`
- Classes: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)`
- Functions (inside and outside a class): `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)`.

Documentation should be meaningful and descriptive, explaining the purpose and functionality of the module, class, or function.
