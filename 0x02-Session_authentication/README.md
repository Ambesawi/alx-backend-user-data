# Session Authentication and Cookies in Python

This project is an educational exercise in implementing session authentication and working with cookies in Python. It provides a basic understanding of these concepts without relying on external modules or frameworks.

## General Concepts

### Authentication

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system.

### Session Authentication

Session authentication involves creating and maintaining user sessions after successful login for secure access.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client's side, often used for session management and data persistence.

### Sending Cookies

This project covers how to send cookies from a server to a client in HTTP response headers.

### Parsing Cookies

Learn how to parse cookies received from clients in HTTP requests to utilize the data effectively.
